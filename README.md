## Description ##

This repository contains a protocol and several scripts to assist users in combining Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) information with ShortBRED output. SSNs are a method of analyzing large enzyme families dividing them into similar clusters. ShortBRED is used to quantify the abundance of proteins in metagenomes. By combining SSN knowledge with ShortBRED quantification, the abundances of members of an enzyme family in a metagenome can be determined.
